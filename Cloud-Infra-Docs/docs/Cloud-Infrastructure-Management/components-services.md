# Components and Services

CloudOps Manager provides a **modular and scalable** infrastructure management system, composed of key components categorized under **Compute, Storage, and Networking**. These components work together to ensure high availability, automation, and cost-efficiency.  

## **Compute Services**  

Compute resources are at the core of cloud infrastructure, providing processing power to run applications and workloads.  

### **Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
*   Deploy and manage virtual machines across **AWS (EC2), Azure (VMs), and GCP (Compute Engine)**.  

*   Pre-configured **VM templates** for quick deployment.  

*   **Auto-scaling support** to adjust capacity based on workload demand.  

### **Containers & Kubernetes**  

*   **Containerized application management** via **Docker** and orchestration with **Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)**.  

*   **Multi-cluster support** for high availability and failover strategies.  

*   **Automated scaling policies** based on CPU, memory, and request load.  

### **Serverless Compute**  

*   Support for **AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions**.  

*   **Event-driven execution** to optimize cost by running workloads only when needed.  

*   Seamless integration with **event triggers and cloud automation workflows**.

## **Storage Services**  

Storage solutions are critical for maintaining application data, backups, and high-availability configurations.  

### **Object Storage**  

*   Integration with **AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and GCP Cloud Storage**.  

*   **Versioning and lifecycle policies** to optimize storage costs.  

*   Built-in **encryption and access control** for security.  

### **Block Storage & Volumes**

*   **Persistent storage for VMs** via **EBS (AWS), Managed Disks (Azure), and Persistent Disks (GCP)**.  

*   **Snapshots & backups** for disaster recovery planning.  

### **Database & Managed Services**  

*   **Support for cloud-native databases** like **Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, and Cloud SQL**.  

*   **Automated scaling** for high-performance database operations.  

*   **Backup & restore functionalities** with point-in-time recovery.

## **Networking Services**  

Networking components enable secure and optimized cloud connectivity.  

### **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & Networking**  

*   Manage **AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, and Google VPC**.  

*   **Custom subnets, IP addressing, and NAT gateways** for private networking.  

*   **Peering and hybrid cloud support** for inter-cloud communication.  

### **Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling**  

*   **Application Load Balancers** for handling traffic efficiently.  

*   **Auto-scaling groups** ensure **on-demand resource scaling**.  

*   **Global Load Balancing** for high availability across regions.  

### **Security & Identity**

*   **Integrated with IAM (Identity and Access Management)** for role-based access.  

*   **Security groups and firewall policies** for network segmentation.  

*   **End-to-end encryption** for data transmission security.
