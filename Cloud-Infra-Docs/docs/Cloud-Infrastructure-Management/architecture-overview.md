# Architecture Overview

The architecture of CloudOps Manager is designed to provide a **scalable, secure, and high-performance** cloud management experience. It integrates seamlessly with multiple cloud providers while maintaining a modular and extensible design.  

## Key Architectural Principles  

CloudOps Manager follows these core architectural principles:  

*   **Multi-Cloud Compatibility** â€“ Supports AWS, Azure, and GCP to prevent vendor lock-in.  

*   **Microservices-Based Architecture** â€“ Modular services to enable flexibility and scalability.  

*   **Event-Driven Automation** â€“ Triggers based on cloud events for automated responses.  

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** â€“ Supports Terraform and Ansible for automated provisioning.  

*   **Security-First Approach** â€“ Role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and compliance enforcement.  

## High-Level Architecture  

The system is composed of the following layers:  

1.  **User Interface (UI) Layer**  

    *   Web-based dashboard and command-line interface (CLI).  

    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for users.  

    *   API access for integrations with external tools.  

2.  **Application & Service Layer**  

    *   *Orchestration Engine* â€“ Automates provisioning, scaling, and deployment.  

    *   *Monitoring Service* â€“ Captures performance metrics and sends alerts.  

    *   *Logging & Analytics* â€“ Aggregates logs and provides intelligent insights.  

    *   *Cost Optimization Module* â€“ Tracks usage and provides cost-saving recommendations.  

3.  **Cloud Provider Integration Layer**  

    *   Securely connects with AWS, Azure, and GCP via APIs.  

    *   Uses SDKs for cloud-native operations (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).  

    *   Ensures cross-cloud compatibility.  

4.  Storage & Database Layer**  

    *   *Configuration Database* â€“ Stores user settings, access controls, and metadata.  

    *   *Event Storage* â€“ Logs real-time system activities for audit and compliance.  

## **Real-World Scenario: Multi-Cloud Deployment**  

**Use Case:** A financial services company wants to manage workloads across AWS and Azure while ensuring compliance with **ISO 27001**.  

âœ… CloudOps Manager enables **multi-cloud provisioning** with standardized policies.

âœ… Security compliance is automated with built-in **access control policies**.

âœ… Real-time monitoring provides visibility into cost and performance metrics.
