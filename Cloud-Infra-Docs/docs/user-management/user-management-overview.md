# User Management

User management is a critical aspect of cloud infrastructure security and governance. It involves defining, controlling, and monitoring access to cloud resources based on user roles and privileges. A well-structured user management system ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific resources, minimizing security risks and maintaining compliance with organizational policies.

This chapter covers the key aspects of user management, including user roles, authentication methods, access control mechanisms, and best practices for securing cloud accounts.

## Understanding User Roles and Permissions
Cloud platforms use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions efficiently. RBAC assigns access rights based on predefined roles rather than individual users, improving security and scalability.

### Common User Roles in Cloud Environments

| Role | Description | Typical Permissions |
|-|-|-|
| Administrator| Full access to all resources, user management, security policies, and billing.| Create, modify, delete users, configure policies, manage billing.|
| Developer | Access to deploy and manage cloud applications and services. | Read, write, and execute privileges on cloud services. |
| Security Officer  | Manages security policies, audits, and compliance. | Configure IAM, monitor security logs, enforce security settings.|
| Billing Manager| Oversees cloud expenditure and budget allocation.| View and manage billing data but no access to technical resources. |
| Read-Only User | Can access resources but cannot modify or deploy new services. | View logs, check configurations, monitor performance. |

## Custom Roles & Least Privilege Principle
Many cloud providers allow the creation of custom roles to tailor access control based on specific organizational needs. Custom roles help enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), ensuring that users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
